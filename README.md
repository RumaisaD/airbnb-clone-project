## Team Roles

- **Backend Developer**: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
- **Database Administrator**: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
- **DevOps Engineer**: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
- **QA Engineer**: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.


## Technology Stack

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used to build the backend and RESTful APIs quickly and securely.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful open-source relational database system used for managing and storing structured application data.
- **GraphQL**: A query language for APIs that allows clients to request only the data they need, improving performance and flexibility.
- **Docker**: A containerization tool used to package the application and its dependencies for consistent deployment across environments.
- **Redis**: An in-memory data structure store used as a cache and message broker to improve performance.
- **Celery**: An asynchronous task queue/job queue based on distributed message passing, used for handling background tasks.

## Database Design

### Entities and Key Fields

#### 1. Users
- `id` (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each user
- `name`: Full name of the user
- `email`: Unique email address for login
- `password`: Encrypted user password
- `created_at`: Timestamp when the user account was created

#### 2. Properties
- `id` (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each property
- `user_id` (Foreign Key): References the owner (user) of the property
- `title`: Property title or listing name
- `description`: Detailed information about the property
- `location`: Geographic location/address
- `price_per_night`: Cost to rent per night

#### 3. Bookings
- `id` (Primary Key): Unique booking ID
- `user_id` (Foreign Key): Guest who made the booking
- `property_id` (Foreign Key): Booked property
- `start_date`: Booking check-in date
- `end_date`: Booking check-out date
- `status`: Booking status (e.g., confirmed, cancelled)

#### 4. Payments
- `id` (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each payment
- `booking_id` (Foreign Key): References the booking being paid for
- `amount`: Total payment amount
- `payment_method`: Method used for the transaction
- `status`: Status of payment (e.g., successful, failed)
- `created_at`: Timestamp of the payment

#### 5. Reviews
- `id` (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each review
- `user_id` (Foreign Key): Reviewer (guest)
- `property_id` (Foreign Key): Reviewed property
- `rating`: Numeric rating (e.g., 1 to 5)
- `comment`: Text review
- `created_at`: Timestamp of review submission

### Entity Relationships

- A **User** can own multiple **Properties** (`user_id` in Properties).
- A **User** can make multiple **Bookings**.
- A **Property** can have many **Bookings** and **Reviews**.
- A **Booking** belongs to one **User** and one **Property**.
- A **Review** is written by a **User** for a **Property**.

## Feature Breakdown

- **API Documentation**: Documenting using OpenAPI standard. Django REST framework: comprehensive RESTful API. GraphQL: flexibile and efficient query 
- **User Authentication**: Register new users, authenticate and manage user profiles.
- **Property Management**: Create, update and retrieve.
- **Booking System**: Make, update and manage bookings + check in and check out.
- **Payment Processing**: Handle payment transactions related to bookings.
- **Review System**: Post and manage reviews for properties.
- **Database Optimization**: Indexing: Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data. Caching: Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance

## API Security


### ðŸ”‘ Authentication
We use **token-based authentication** (e.g., JWT) to verify the identity of users accessing the API. Only authenticated users can perform certain operations like booking a property or writing a review.

**Why it's important**: Prevents unauthorized access to user accounts and protects sensitive data such as personal information and booking history.

### ðŸ›‚ Authorization
Role-based access control (RBAC) is enforced to ensure users can only perform actions they're permitted to (e.g., only property owners can edit their own listings).

**Why it's important**: Ensures that users canâ€™t access or modify data they donâ€™t own, maintaining trust and system integrity.

### ðŸš« Rate Limiting
We apply rate limiting to restrict the number of API requests per user or IP address over time. This helps mitigate denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and abuse.

**Why it's important**: Protects the API from being overwhelmed by excessive traffic, whether accidental or malicious.

### ðŸ”’ Data Encryption
All data transmission is secured using **HTTPS** to encrypt data in transit.

**Why it's important**: Protects against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks, especially during login or payment operations.

### ðŸ’³ Payment Security
Payment endpoints are integrated with secure, PCI-compliant providers. We do not store raw credit card data on our servers.

## ðŸš€ CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?

**CI/CD** stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment/Delivery**. It is a set of practices that automatically build, test, and deploy code changes, ensuring fast and reliable software delivery.

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automatically tests and integrates code changes from multiple contributors into the main branch, reducing bugs and integration issues.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Automatically deploys the latest code to a staging or production environment after passing tests.

### Why CI/CD is Important

- ðŸš« **Reduces Human Error**: Automates repetitive tasks like testing and deployment.
- âš¡ **Faster Releases**: Streamlines the development workflow and enables quicker feature delivery.
- ðŸ”’ **Improves Quality**: Ensures code is tested consistently and automatically before deployment.
- ðŸ”„ **Feedback Loop**: Gives developers immediate feedback on code health and test status.

### Tools Used

- **GitHub Actions**: For automating workflows such as testing, linting, and deployment on every push or pull
